/* 25.Group By :

Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array which generate that key.

The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.
The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

        }
